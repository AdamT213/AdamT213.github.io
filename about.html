<p>Greetings! I am a New Jersey native living in San Francisco and embarking on the exciting journey that is a career in web development. I am 22 years old, and after graduating high school, working several jobs, spending a year studying engineering fundamentals, and moving across the country, I have finally stumbled upon the career path for me. I am super excited to begin this process and learn valuable skills along the way!</p>
